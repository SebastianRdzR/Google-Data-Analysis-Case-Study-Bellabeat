# Google Data Analyrics Professional Certificate case study
## Bellabeat Fitness Tracking App Analysis | Excel, SQL & Tableau

This is my final project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, an exploratory analysis for Bellabeat.

The main objective of the project is to do an exploratory analysis on the dataset to answer some questions and present the key findings.

### Deliverables
1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of all data cleanses and manipulations
4. A summary of your analysis
